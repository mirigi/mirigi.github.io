Mirigi's amenity reservation feature makes it easy for condo residents to find and book amenities like barbecue areas or tennis courts whenever they want. This tool lets residents plan their fun activities without the hassle of manual scheduling, ensuring they can reserve their favorite times from anywhere. With a built-in reminder system, Mirigi helps residents keep track of their plans, reducing the chance of missing reservations and improving their living experience.

For the staff, this feature simplifies managing amenity bookings, reduces administrative work, and avoids scheduling conflicts. The digital system accurately records all reservations, giving staff a clear view of how amenities are used. This boosts efficiency and service quality, allowing staff to focus on maintaining amenities and meeting residents' needs instead of handling bookings manually. Optionally, the system can report generated expenses to a compatible expense management system, automatically adding them to the next resident's expense invoice. Overall, Mirigi's amenity reservation feature creates a more organized and resident-friendly condo environment.
