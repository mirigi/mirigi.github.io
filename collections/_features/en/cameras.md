Accessible on all supported platforms, the **pool-cam** and other camera feeds offer a seamless viewing experience, allowing users to stay informed about the current conditions of their building's amenities. Whether it's checking the pool's occupancy or monitoring the lobby's activity, the live streaming feature enhances the overall living experience by providing peace of mind and convenience at the touch of a button.

Moreover, the integrationof this feature into the Mirigi digital concierge solution underscores the commitment to leveraging technology for improved residential living. By enabling residents to make informed decisions about their use of communal spaces, the camera functionality not only promotes safety but also enhances the quality of life within the community.
