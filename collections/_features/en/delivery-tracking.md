**Mirigi's delivery tracking feature** offers a seamless experience for both residents and staff by enhancing package management. Residents are informed in **real-time** when a package is received, ensuring transparency and efficiency. This feature eliminates the need for residents to constantly check package trackers, providing them with peace of mind and convenience.

From the staff's perspective, this feature allows for **internal tracking of packages**, maintaining control over the storage room, and securely managing deliveries. When a package is handed over, Mirigi can request a **signature for secure confirmation**. If delivering to a user-specified location, it can **store a picture of the delivery event**, providing residents with visual confirmation of how and where their packages were delivered. This not only improves operational efficiency but also enhances the quality of service provided to residents, as staff can focus on maintaining the storage area and addressing residents' needs rather than managing deliveries manually.
