Mirigi seamlessly integrates with various **expense management systems**, empowering residents to effortlessly view their **expenses**, see the currently **owed amount**, and make **online payments**. This integration ensures that all user transactions are automatically communicated to the expense management system for **streamlined processing**.

For instance, when a resident reserves the **barbecue area**, the expense management system is automatically notified to add the **cleaning fee** to the resident's account. 

This functionality may require special development to ensure smooth integration with the selected expense management system.
