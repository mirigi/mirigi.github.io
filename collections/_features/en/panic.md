The **"PANIC BUTTON"** feature in the Mirigi smart concierge solution **allows residents to quickly alert staff in case of emergencies** such as health issues, security threats, or fires. Residents can trigger alarms directly from their devices, ensuring that staff can take immediate action, such as contacting the resident's emergency health assistant or notifying family members. For example, they can call the fire department or police in case of such emergencies.

Residents can activate the panic button using the condominium Mirigi app, which is always available. Additionally, when integrated with a compatible home automation system, residents can use remote controllers or an in-wall keypad to trigger alerts.

The panic button feature includes a default action plan for the building, but residents can also set up custom actions in advance, like calling a family member. This feature enhances safety and provides peace of mind, knowing that help is just a button press away.

As with all Mirigi features, the panic button is optional and can be enabled or disabled by the condominium manager.
