**Mirigi's paperless feature** offers an eco-friendly way to send messages to residents, who can receive them on their mobile phones or touch panels. This feature not only reduces the environmental impact of paper usage but also enhances communication efficiency by ensuring that residents receive important information promptly and conveniently.

From the staff's perspective, this feature streamlines the communication process, reducing the need for physical mailings and minimizing administrative workload. The digital system ensures that all messages are recorded accurately, providing staff with a clear overview of communication history. This not only improves operational efficiency but also enhances the quality of service provided to residents, as staff can focus on addressing residents' needs rather than managing paper-based communications. The messaging system comes with a very unique **AI assistant** that utilizes its previous knowledge to help the staff create the perfect message with less effort.
