Customers can access a restaurant's full menu directly from the app, allowing them to make their selections and receive real-time updates on their order status, from preparation to delivery. This ensures a smooth and efficient dining experience, whether they are ordering from home or while visiting the restaurant.

From the restaurant staff's perspective, this feature streamlines the order handling process, making it easier to manage requests while keeping customers informed. This allows staff to focus more on food preparation and service quality, enhancing the overall dining experience. Mirigi's integration with popular delivery services like UberEats, PedidosYa, and Rappi further ensures that orders are delivered promptly and efficiently, meeting the high expectations of today's diners.

By focusing on restaurant solutions, Mirigi not only improves operational efficiency but also elevates customer satisfaction, making it an indispensable tool for modern dining establishments.
