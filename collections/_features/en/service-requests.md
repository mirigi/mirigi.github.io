**Mirigi's service requests feature** allows residents to fill out custom forms on their touch screen or smartphone to make special requests. These requests are sent to the designated staff member and can be monitored by managers, who will receive user feedback after the issue is resolved. This feature provides residents with a convenient and efficient way to communicate their needs, ensuring that their requests are addressed promptly and effectively.

For staff, this feature streamlines the management of service requests, reducing administrative workload and minimizing response times. The digital system ensures that all requests are recorded accurately, providing staff with a clear overview of outstanding tasks. This not only improves operational efficiency but also enhances the quality of service provided to residents, as staff can focus on addressing residents' needs rather than managing requests manually.
