**Mirigi's valet parking feature** allows residents to request their car from anywhere, even through Alexa. Residents can track their request in **real-time** and receive a notification on their mobile phone when their car is ready, providing them with convenience and peace of mind.

For valet staff, this feature simplifies the management of parking requests, reducing administrative workload and minimizing wait times. The digital system ensures that all requests are recorded accurately, providing staff with a clear overview of parking activity. Valet staff can easily save time-stamped photos to Mirigi for peace of mind regarding car scratch or dent complaints. This not only improves operational efficiency but also enhances the quality of service provided to residents, as staff can focus on delivering exceptional service rather than managing parking requests manually.
